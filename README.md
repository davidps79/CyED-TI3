  **Description:** 
		
    The Simulation VIP team from Universidad Icesi contacted us for an amazing and interesting project.    It’s about data simulation in the American continent. Them,  we must develop a prototype that can simulate the creation, read, update and delete datas. For this, we needed resources such as datasets with names and last names of people, also documents and statistical studies with distribution of age and height in countries of the American continent. The limit number of generate data is 1 million. For this, our project must be effective and fast. 

    As idea, we think that the datasets with names should be divided in two, one for boy names, other for girl names. Besides, we save the data of age and height distribution datasets (in cvs) in order to make the program faster in the data process.
